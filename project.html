              <p class="category">Cyber Security</p>
              <p><b><u>Domain</u>: </b>AES, Elliptical Curve Diffie Hellman, Encryption-Decryption, Secure Hash Algorithm
              <br>
              <ul>
                <li>The approach presented in this project involves the following concepts to ensure that data
                    transferred to the cloud is secure and not intercepted and manipulated by an attacker. AES
                    symmetric cryptography is used to encrypt and decrypt the data that will be sent to the cloud.
                    Elliptic Curve Diffie Hellman (ECDH) is used to exchange the secret key between the user and
                    the cloud. This secret key helps us to encrypt the data when send by the user to the cloud and also
                    while decrypting the data from cloud when the user wants to access the data.</li>
                <li>The purpose of the approach proposed in this paper is to enhance the security of data transfer
                    between the user and the cloud using ECDH algorithm for key exchange along with the improved
                    ECC. For this reason, the approach mentioned in the paper uses ECDH mechanism to exchange
                    the keys between the user and cloud. The challenge is to use in cloud servers with respect to time
                    and memory limitations during encryption and decryption process in servers due to its sharing
                    performance.</li>
                <li>Elliptic Curve Diffie Hellman (ECDH) is used to exchange the secret key between the user and
                    the cloud and AES symmetric cryptography is used to encrypt and decrypt the data that will be
                    sent to the cloud. The ciphertext generated for a particular plain text will always be different which
                    will make it hard for the attacker to be able to decrypt the data which makes this encryption
                    technique unique and hard to decode.</li>

              <ul>
                <li>As we all know that in today’s world of networking, a secure transmission of information with the
                    help of image encryption which can either contain some kind of information or any text
                    information is one of the most important focuses for security.</li>
                <li>In our project I am introducing a (t, n) secret sharing scheme for image encryption. This method
                    encrypts the secret image into two images as the same size of the original image, which one is the
                    public image (called the encrypted image) and another is to be shared among n participants using
                    a new secret sharing method based on the Shamir’s secret sharing.</li>
                <li>In the secret sharing scheme, t
                    (or more) shares secretly held by the participants could reconstruct the shared image, where the
                    size of each share is 2(log m) t 2 / m of that of the shared m*m image. Then the secret image could
                    be recovered from the encrypted image and the shared image through simple XOR operations
                    without any loss.</li>

              <br>
              <ul>
                <li>The Internet is a complex entity composed of diverse networks, users, and resources. There are some
                    advanced users who use their knowledge to explore potential system vulnerabilities. Hackers can
                    compromise vulnerable hosts by exploiting resources or use them as tools for attacks. The launch of
                    an effective attack often begins with an earlier and deliberate process of analyzing potential victims’
                    hosts or networks.</li>
                <li>The application model is based on python libraries and exploits the knowledge of networking
                        interfaces of a system. At this
                        moment it was basically a python script which loops over a specified ‘hard-coded’ range and detects
                        if your system has any port open. . After getting the desired output we started implementing multi-threading and
                        reducing the time required for scanning ports to enhance the code. Multi-threading is a concept which
                        makes use of more than one processor to carry out a single task. It simultaneously works on
                        subsequent parts of a process and very efficiently reduces the time. </li>
                <li>It detects the IP addresses that are live and displays it to the user. The next was
                    to enhance IP scanning and move to DNS records. After successful accomplishment of first three
                    objectives development in the UI for this project began. Now, for the functioning of the python script
                    with HTML, a need for a python-based framework arose. Which takes us to next major progress i.e.
                    Connectivity between python script and the rendering of output in UI. This was done using Flask.</li>

                    spread of COVID-19 in public places. 2-meter physical distance has been set as the mandatory safety
                    measures in most public places like schools, shopping centers, public transport and other covered areas by
                    the majority of national health authorities and governments.</li>
                <li>Using CCTV footage from security cameras, I developed an automated people detection, tracking and inter-people distance estimation system 
                    with the help of Deep Neural Network Based model as part of the research.</li>
                <li>I used the YOLOv3-based framework and also inverse perspective mapping for accurate
                    social distancing monitoring in challenging conditions and people detection, including people occlusion,
                    light variations, and partial visibility. I used the COCO dataset to train my model. From moving trajectories and rate of social distancing violations and
                    statistical analysis of Spatio-temporal data, we have provided an online risk assessment scheme. </li>

                <li>This paper provides an algorithm for the realization of the popular computer games incorporated
                    in a Gaming Console. The basic idea of this work was the development of a gaming console using
                    DOSBox programming environment and libraries used for easier implementation of the game in
                    assembly programming language. Assembler (assembly) language is a low-level programming
                    language, and it is specific to a particular processor (microcontroller) architecture.</li>
                <li>The assembly is used when we need fast and efficient processing of the signal. The
                    MASM library makes programming in assembly easier and provides libraries for work with strings
                    and support for DOSBox features. Some of the main supporting features are graphical environment functions. In this paper, I describe designing a game box using the x86 architecture with MASM libraries in the

                        the three great classics Brick Break, Snake, and finally the most loved Ping Pong. I also tried to understand the maximum potential in which the 8086 microprocessors could
                        be used and what better way could be the development of games as it exhausts all possibilities for
                        any processors as they are an enigma in itself an epitome of testimony to testify the strength and
                        tenure of any microprocessor.</li>

                  <li>As the name suggests “word search” is about searching words in documents parallelly using
                    OPENMP. This is not just a simple word search but it also ranks the documents based on the
                    relevance of the documents with respect to the searched word.
                    The Results are the displayed on a web page which uses PHP (Server-side Scripting language) to
                    render the result. Word search is used everywhere from local page search (Ctrl + F) to searching
                    words on document viewer like “reader” in windows. </li>
                  <li>In fact, a whole branch called Information Retrieval was developed for this. This project was
                    actually inspired by Information Retrieval. It has a lot of application in real word. As the name

              <ul>
                  <li>Phishing is a type of misrepresentation where the aggressor attempts to learn delicate data, for example,
                    login accreditations or record data by sending as a legitimate substance or individual in email or other
                    correspondence channels. Ordinarily, a casualty gets a message that seems to have been sent by a known
                    contact or association. The message contains malignant programming focusing on the client's PC or has
                    connections to guide casualties to pernicious sites to fool them into disclosing individual and monetary
                    data, like passwords, account IDs or Visa subtleties. </li>
                    <li>I used three different methods. (1) URL Classification - Checks assuming that the URLs inside the email are phishing or not. Phishing URL
                        recognition dependent on highlights in URL like length of URL, presence of @ image, prefix and addition
                        isolated by '- ' in area names, presence of IP address, presence of redirection "//". (2) Text Classification-We arrange email text content dependent on word recurrence and in light of semantic
                        investigation. (3) Message ID Classification-Every email is related with a Message ID. The Message-ID resembles an
                        advanced finger impression of a message and is generally added by the mail server that sends your message
                        out in the interest of your mail customer.</li>

                  <li>Sending notifications, may be a very hectic and a very tough task to figure out if there is
                    no particular order in which the messages may be sent and no fixed limit on the size and
                    speed of messages, which may become inefficient in urgent needs.</li>
                  <li>So, to make sure that the messages sent and received are in a particular order and have a
                    fixed receiver’s address, we make use of Queues. Queues are known to operate on a
                    general FIFO rule. (FIRST INPUT FIRST OUTPUT).</li>
                    <li>FIFO (First-In-First-Out) queues are designed to enhance messaging between applications
                        when the order of operations and events is critical, or where duplicates can't be tolerated.
                        The order in which messages are sent and received is strictly preserved and a message is
                        delivered once and remains available until a consumer processes and deletes it. </li>
                    <li>The details of the messages will come to the user itself and will also be saved on our server.
                        We also have made sure that the message sent are also stored in a backup file, on our server,
                        where if anything happens to our current queue messages, we don’t lose the information
                        stored in the message. Messages that belong to the same message person are always
                        processed one by one, in a strict order relative to the message group.</li>

                    organizing a club. We have designed and created an android device application that will help all
                    clubs to organize better. We have addressed all the problems that arise within a club when it comes to news and updates.
                    In our app, we have made a login page for all the members. Now as we know, members of the club
                    are recruited by senior club members.</li>
                  <li>Therefore, we only have a login page. The members of the
                    club will be given usernames and dummy passwords by admins (senior members) and only those
                    people will be allowed to use the application. This adds a level of security and authentication to
                    the application.</li>
                <li>The application has a common interface for different types of technical and non-technical clubs.
                    Board Members of the club can update the database as currently the application does not have an
                    admin portal. The members of a club will get a unique id to login and access the application.
                    Club members can view all the ongoing activities, upcoming events as well as the schedule of
                    their meetings and duties. They can give their profile and can also post their availability or
                    unavailability for a meeting or duty.</li>

              <br>
              <ul>
                  <li>With the increasing number of cars and traffic, it has become a major problem to find place
                    for parking cars in public places such as market places or malls or any famous place. This results in
                    severe congestion. There are cases where parking slots are available but they are either
                    isolated, or too far from the entry point or not known to drivers.</li>
                  <li>I am going to use Semaphore and FCFS Synchronization as a non-pre-emptive scheduling
                    algorithm. Basically, I am going to use two Semaphores and a switch for the entire process
                    of automatic parking. A semaphore, in its most basic form, is a protected integer variable that can facilitate and
                    restrict access to shared resources in a multi- processing environment.</li>
                    <li>While the deadlock avoidance procedure takes place through semaphores all the waiting
                        vehicles in the queue needs a scheduling order. Since pre-emptive methods are not suitable
                        in parking systems as I cannot again disturb a car’s position. So I am going to use non preemptive First Come First Serve Scheduling Algorithm. I am aiming to use Process
                        Synchronization and their scheduling the most important concepts of Operating Systems
                        to solve the problems of parking management.</li>

              <br>
              <ul>
                  <li>The government and a large number of private companies have built a 
                    number of sporting facilities to encourage the playing of sports. However, 
                    not everyone can always easily use these services. At times, even when they 
                    are, they are typically quite packed. Additionally, these facilities are 
                    typically in poor shape since the proprietors lack any motivation to handle 
                    them well because they are not very profitable. The causes are lack of 
                    visibility and spotlight marketing having a coordinated effect and no one to 
                    address these issues. There's a void between those who have an interest in 
                    sports and those who are administering the sporting venues, a gap that we 
                    want to fill with our idea.</li>
                  <li>This issue can be effectively solved by our Android mobile application, 
                    which we developed. The programme is called Grook. With the help of the sports 
                    management software Grook, users can reserve local sports fields, courts, and 
                    other facilities for certain times, ensuring that they always have a place to 
                    play. It enables facility managers to run their businesses more effectively and 
                    also compiles all of the sporting venues close to the user's location.</li>
                <li>Creating teams with other users who share your interest in certain sports is 
                    another feature of our app. Users must pay a nominal charge to the sports facility 
                    administration to reserve a time slot for them, depending on the sports facility 
                    and the sport they desire to play. We now have our database, which contains the date, 
                    day, month, year, the name of the sports facility, the total cost, and the total 
                    number of clients, utilising the data from all of these entries. The amount of 
                    consumers that make reservations at a facility and the various sports for which

              <br>
              <ul>
                <li>We have developed a website Healthcare Saviour, that's the most effective solution for all
                    healthcare related issues. This platform enhances remote doctor-patient interaction. And provides
                    users a far better chance to interact visually with doctors, thanks to the damaging consequences
                    and absence of on-line platforms for healthcare offerings, the patients are struggling via way of
                    means of getting premature remedy or no remedy in any respect.</li>
                <li>To deal with the above issues, we've determined to construct an web application Platform called
                    Healthcare Saviour for correct healthcare offerings of the people. the need of our project is huge
                    because it'll solve many issues in today’s world, variety of which are noted above. The people
                    seeking medical help could easily login through the net app and see a doctor online.</li>
                <li>Users will be able to request for organs if
                    they want or else they could even sign up for organ donation. Similarly, customers
                    can also register for blood donation. In the meantime, users can also search for
                    different hospitals, according to their illness. For Hospital administration, our
                    website will provide a platform to request blood, organs, ambulance and other
                    critical medical related needs from other hospitals. This will enhance the efficiency
                    of hospitals, thus facilitating patients and increasing their comfort.

              <ul>
                  <li>Have you heard of the Pomodoro technique? The Pomodoro technique is a time management method 
                    that increases your productivity and efficiency. Our entire group believes in the Pomodoro way 
                    of working which dictates that you have to work for 25-minutes and then take a 5-minute break. 
                    When we found out that there is no application out there to fulfill all of our requirements in 
                    one place, we saw an opportunity. Selfuel – The Pomodoro Way, a perfect app to cater to all your work needs.</li>
                  <li>Our application implements this technique very beautifully. The user is supposed to enter all 
                    the tasks and the approximate minutes (multiples of 25) the user will take to complete the task. 
                    Selfuel will create a ToDo List of all the tasks. ToDo List is a simple tool to keep a record of the 
                    tasks the user needs to complete. Along with adding new tasks the user has the option to delete and 
                    edit the already added tasks. As soon as the user clicks on the task to begin it. The clock will 
                    start and will work according to Pomodoro minutes i.e. Once the clock starts, the user is supposed 
                    to work straight for 25 minutes. After 25 minutes the clock will start the break time of 5 
                    minutes and suppose if the user has set the time to 50 minutes the clock will again start for the next 25 minutes.
                    </li>
                    <li>For developing interest and attracting users application has a feature to add their friends and see their score on the leaderboard. 
                      This competitive behavior will motivate and compel the users to stay focused and complete the task in duration.
                      Studying and working go faster and are more enjoyable when you have a soundtrack. The application allows to 
                      user to upload his favorite playlist which can be played while completing the task.
